                    mentioned we had to show case one game but I just thought it would be a nice idea to create a static
                    website showcasing some more games and practicing my skills in the manner. So with patiently I
                    curated a list of 5 games to showcase my experience and the memory i have with these games. GTAs
                    been my favorite series so far, but we can't forget the battlefield 3 too, and out of nowhere in
                    this list comes Factorio arguably one of the most addicting game which need some serious problem
                    solving and logical skills to be a master at it.</p>

                <p>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, commonly known as GTA San Andreas, is an action-adventure video game
                    developed by Rockstar North and released in 2004. Set in the fictional state of San Andreas, the
                    game follows the story of Carl "CJ" Johnson, who returns to his hometown of Los Santos after the
                    murder of his mother. The game is renowned for its open-world gameplay, where players can freely
                    roam the vast landscape, engage in various missions, and explore a detailed and immersive
                    environment.</p>

                <h1>GTA 4</h1>
                <p>

                    GTA IV has the best graphics for its time. It’s the only game where it’s actually fun to mess around
                    and lose the cops. It has the best physics.

                    It’s the only game that feels like it has a realistic atmosphere in the city. It’s the most
                    difficult game to complete.

                    It was incredible when it came out. It was a MASSIVE jump in graphics and gameplay from the previous
                    main titles. The story was immersive. The map was limited, but still really fun.
                    You feel like you are a person who lives in the city, where in GTA 5 and older games, it feels like
                    you own the city.

                    The story is by far the best in the series and personally is my favorite story in gaming period.
                    Also, Niko is my favorite video game main character.

                    Fun gameplay, fun story, fab characters, great radio stations, amazing view on mount chilad, golf!

                    Oh and chop

                    I love everything about 5, like I love everything in every other GTA game. They’re all great games
                    with so much fun shit in every one of them.
                    Not to mention the ability to swap between 3 main characters at any point you would like.
                    For me it was how seamlessly it tied your open world activities to the story, like how Michael's
                    dialogues during therapy sessions change depending on your preceding actions in the open world. This
                    is also one of the many things that I think GTA V improved upon GTA IV.
                    Balanced car physics, fun gameplay, fun missions, detailed city and ingame activities.
                    it was perfect down to the last minute details

                <p>

                    Here was one way Batt3 undeniably excelled over every other subsequent battlefield.In battlefield 3, you honestly feel like you're playing as some random dude in a world that feels like it actually exists. 
                    From campaign to multiplayer, there was a very distinct and consistent art direction present in the construction of the maps and characters. It was one of the first times a lot of us felt so completely immersed in a game with this level of gameplay freedom. The menus, the music, and I think even that blue filter helped contribute to that. A flash of seeing a jet scream over the top of the Alborz Mountains peak. nother flash of watching an American Assault stab a guy in a crater on Karkand and I was watching through my scoped M40A5, I could only see the Russian dude's arm as he was flipped over. I really miss those days of coming home from school login into my computer and then playing whatever the I want to play that day.

                <p>
                    Talking about this wonderfull and suprizingly addicting game, so addictive I ended up playing it the whole night without sleep before my MA105 midsemster exams, still got some marks thoug XD.Well it's not easy to get addicted but when you get It's hard to quit. At start I was like how can one game be this addictive I had to try so I pirated the game then I start playing the tutorial I kinda a like it but it all seems too boring for me exploring, mining resources, killing mites (Alien species on which our spaceships is crashed *well don't go into details of the game its just not interesting) then quit for some day then I started playing again then 1 hour, 2 hour, the rest of the night passed so quickly and I haven't moved an inch, that is some black magic here. Well the most OCD game, like OPTIMIZATION, OPTIMIZATION and OPTIMIZATION. We are on some strange planet and we have to create a rocket that can go into space just to endup on some other planet( procedural generation (Ahhh! bring a course on game dev too )) and you have to optimezed or plan or strategize or whatever you want to say you have to do that for better performance, and also automation it hase conveyors clippers and bots and what not. And here i am deleting everysingle game just not to get too distracted.
                    Also you can make your own in game computer like using its provided logics like in minecraft.
