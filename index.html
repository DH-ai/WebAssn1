As mentioned we had to show case one game but I just thought it would be a nice idea to create a static website showcasing some more games and practicing my skills in the manner. So with patiently I curated a list of 5 games to showcase my experience and the memory i have with these games. GTAs been my favorite series so far, but we can't forget the battlefield 3 too, and out of nowhere in this list comes Factorio arguably one of the most addicting game which need some serious problem solving and logical skills to be a master at it.</p>
